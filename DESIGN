We are writing a text editor that may have the capability of collaborative editing.
We will be using a curses interface to display and edit the text.

Since we're working with strings, we'll be consistently allocating and reallocating memory.
We'll be working with files because text editors usually edit the text within files.
We'll display the statistics about the file (e.g, # of lines, characters, display [RO] flag if read only)
Make it all asynchronous.
We will eat the SIGINT signal so the user can save the buffer.
Read from stdin into buffer if first argument is a '-'
Will implement server-client design.
Will keep text buffer in shared memory so that other clients can access it.
Use of semaphores to handle file access control

Will have a struct to hold rows and have an array of these rows to comprise the text buffer.
