Description:
    We are writing a text editor that may allow collaborative editing.
    We will be using a curses interface to display and edit the text.

Technical Design:
    Working with strings requires consistent allocation and reallocation of memory.
    Text editors usually edit the text within files.
    Display statistics about the file (e.g., # of lines, characters; display [RO] flag if read only)
    Make it all asynchronous.
    Eat the SIGINT signal so the user can save the buffer.
    Read from stdin into buffer if first argument is a '-'.
    Will implement server-client design.
    Will keep text buffer in shared memory so that other clients can access it.
    Use of semaphores to handle file access control.

    Work will be done by the person with free time.
    Contributions by each member should even out.

    Will have a struct to hold the content of a row and an array of these rows comprising the text buffer.

Due Dates:
    The entire project should be completed before the deadline.
